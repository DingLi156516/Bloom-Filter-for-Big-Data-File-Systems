This project aims at implementing a file system metadata scheme that uses bloom filter to avoid unnecessary SSD/disk accesses. This mechanism is especially useful for big data file systems (i.e. HDFS, ClusterFS) where at least hundreds of thousands of files exist in each directory and analytical queries over those files are required. The experiment shows that our method dramatically improved file query performance compared to the existing scheme. In addition, the implementation overhead of the proposed scheme is small.
